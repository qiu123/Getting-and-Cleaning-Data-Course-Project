## How to get source data and use R code

1. You have to download sourse data from link below and unzip it to working directory of R Studio.
2. You have to perform R script by using R Studio.

## About source data
As sourse data for work was used Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

## About R code

File with R code "run_analysis.R" perform 5 following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work):
0. Collect the raw data
  0.1 Downloading dataset
  0.2 Unzip dataSet to /data directory
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.   
  1.1 Reading files    
    1.1.1 Reading trainings tables   
    1.1.2 Reading testing tables   
    1.1.3 Reading feature vector   
    1.1.4 Reading activity labels   
  1.2 Assigning column names   
  1.3 Merging all data in one set   
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement   
  2.1 Reading column names  
  2.2 Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation   
  2.3 Making nessesary subset from setAllInOne   
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set   
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names   
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject   
  5.1 Making second tidy data set   
  5.2 Writing second tidy data set in txt file   

All row data is from the `data`folder.


## About variables: 

* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
